# History
Sound of Waves was founded by two developers (PT Zhang and Michael Wang) at the 2017 Global Game Jam in American University, Maryland. During the Game Jam, PT and Michael worked with two other developers to make Abyss Siren, a first person shooter game with audio input for the HTC Vive. After the Game Jam, PT and Michael decided to continue the concept conceived by Abyss Siren and developed Banshee VR, the spiritual successor for iOS and Android. We wanted to explore the cathartic power of voice by focusing the central mechanics of the game on translating the player's voice into destructive shock-waves.
