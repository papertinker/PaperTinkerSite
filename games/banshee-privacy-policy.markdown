# **Privacy Policy** 

Your privacy is important to us. Our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a minute to review the details of our privacy practices below.

Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information
We do not collect information. We do request access to your microphone and file system in order to react to your sounds, but we never collect that data.

Collection and Use of Personal Information
No personal information will be collected when you are using Banshee. 

When you use our email support services, we collect your correspondence in order to build up a public knowledge base, which will be available to all users of the site. Your correspondence will most likely not be used verbatim, but paraphrased in an FAQ format.
 
Third party accounts
HD Camera does not store your Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, or other third part service passwords. Your account information is not disclosed to HD Camera and you are free to cancel any of your social networking website connections with HD Camera at any time.

Enforcement
We regularly review our own compliance with our Privacy Policy. If you submit a formal written complaint, we will contact you and try our best to resolve the issue.

Changes
Our Privacy Policy may change occasionally. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without providing explicit, advance notice. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, in the event of significant changes, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as an email notification). 

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us.
